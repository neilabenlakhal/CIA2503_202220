/* Variables:
In JavaScript, variables are declared using the var, let, or const keywords. 
The syntax for declaring a variable is: 

var variableName = value;
let variableName = value;
const variableName= value;

 var is function scoped and its value can be changed after it is declared. 

let is block scoped and also allows you to change its value, 
but you can't declare a let variable with the same name in the same scope. 
const is also block scoped, but its value cannot be changed after it is declared.
